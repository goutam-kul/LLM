# FAQ 

# what is an LLM ?
LLM stand for large langugage models. An LLM is a machine learning model capable of generating understanding and interpret natural languages. 

# Why are they called LLM?
LLMs are deep learning models with huge number of parameters from millions to couple hundred billions. They are trained on terabytes, sometimes petabye of data using thousands of GBs of GPUs. This is why they are called Large Language models.

# What is fine-tuning?
LLMs are trained in such a way that they become good at doing multiple tasks but they are not the best for doing one specific task. But, they can be trained to become specialized in doing one singular task. This process is called fine-tuning, where we update the model parameters using different methods to make the model more align with our use case.
