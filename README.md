# FAQ 

## what is an LLM ?
from IMB - 
> " ___Large language models (LLMs) are a category of foundation models trained on immense amounts of data making them capable of understanding and generating natural language and other types of content to perform a wide range of tasks.___ "

# What are Foundation Models ?
from AWS - 
> " ___Trained on massive datasets, foundation models (FMs) are large deep learning neural networks that have changed the way data scientists approach machine learning (ML). Rather than develop artificial intelligence (AI) from scratch, data scientists use a foundation model as a starting point to develop ML models that power new applications more quickly and cost-effectively.___ "

## Why are they called LLM?
LLMs are deep learning models with huge number of parameters from millions to hundred billions. They are trained on terabytes, sometimes petabyte of data using thousands of GBs of GPUs. Due to these scales of parameters they are called Large Language Models.

## What is fine-tuning?
LLMs are trained in such a way that they become good at doing multiple tasks but they are not the best for doing one specific task. But, they can be trained to become specialized in doing one singular task. This process is called fine-tuning, where we update the model parameters using different methods to make the model more aligned with our use case.
